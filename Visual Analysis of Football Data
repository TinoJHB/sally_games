⦁	KEY ISSUES

The following two points were identified as key issues.

Data availability: Puzzle game development relies on access to data and analytics to identify patterns and trends in player behavior and make design decisions accordingly. However, there is limited data available for puzzle game development, and it can be difficult to collect and analyze data due to the complex and varied nature of puzzle games.

This limited access to data can hinder comprehensive analysis and understanding of puzzle game design. Without a complete dataset, it is difficult to draw meaningful conclusions about the effectiveness of different design principles and programming languages. Furthermore, the data that is available is often limited to a small subset of the total number of puzzle games played, which can limit the scope of analysis.

To overcome these limitations, it is essential for puzzle game developers to explore avenues for collecting and analyzing data more effectively. This could include implementing data collection mechanisms within the game itself, partnering with analytics companies to access broader data sets, or collaborating with other game developers to share data and insights.

By doing so, puzzle game developers can contribute to the growth of the puzzle game design community and enable more comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of different design principles and programming languages. This, in turn, could lead to the development of more engaging and challenging puzzle games that appeal to a broad audience.
 
Lack of standardisation: The lack of standardisation in data collection poses a significant challenge in comparing datasets and drawing meaningful conclusions in puzzle game design. Different companies and developers employ varying methods and definitions for data points, leading to questions about the inconsistencies in analysis that may result in inaccurate conclusions.

For example, different puzzle games may have different metrics for measuring player engagement or difficulty levels, making it difficult to compare the effectiveness of different design principles across games. Furthermore, there may be differences in the way that data is collected and analyzed for different puzzle games, leading to inconsistencies in the conclusions that can be drawn.

To overcome these limitations, it is essential for puzzle game developers to explore avenues for standardising data collection methods and definitions. This could involve establishing industry-wide standards for measuring key metrics in puzzle game design, or collaborating with other game developers to share data and insights.

By doing so, puzzle game developers can improve the consistency and accuracy of data analysis, enabling more meaningful comparisons and conclusions to be drawn. This, in turn, could lead to the development of more engaging and challenging puzzle games that appeal to a broad audience.
